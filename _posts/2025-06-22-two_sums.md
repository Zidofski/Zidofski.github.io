# let's get started 

first of all understanding hashmaps is key to solve this problem : 


How I Finally Understood HashMaps (Thanks to a Library)
I used to struggle with hashmaps until I pictured them like my local library. Here's the analogy that made it click for me:

The Library = A HashMap

Your key (like a book title) gets processed by a hash function (the librarian's Dewey Decimal system), which tells you exactly which shelf to go to. No wandering aroundâ€”just straight to the right spot.

Why This is a Game-Changer ?

Without hashmaps: You scan every book until you find The Hobbit (O(n) time).

With hashmaps: The librarian (hash function) points you directly to shelf 12 (O(1) time).

now lets dive into the solution :

explanation : 

Class Definition
class Solution: defines a solution class.
def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]: is the method that takes:

nums: list of integers

target: the target sum
Returns indices of two numbers that add up to target.

Hash Map Setup
prevMap = {} creates a dictionary to store:

Keys: numbers we've seen (val)

Values: their indices (index)

Loop Through Numbers
for i, n in enumerate(nums): iterates with:

i: current index

n: current number

Find Complement
diff = target - n calculates the needed number to reach target.

Check for Solution
if diff in prevMap: checks if we've seen the complement before.
If yes: return [prevMap[diff], i] returns both indices.

Store Current Number
prevMap[n] = i saves the number and its index for future checks.
